# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## 1. Short Answer Questions

### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

**Primary Differences:**

* **Computation Graph Paradigm:**
    * **TensorFlow (TF 1.x): Static Graphs (Define-and-Run):** You first define the entire computation graph (the neural network structure) and then execute it. This allows for compiler optimizations and easier deployment but can make debugging harder.
    * **PyTorch: Dynamic Graphs (Define-by-Run):** The graph is built on the fly as operations are performed. This makes PyTorch more flexible and intuitive, especially for debugging (as you can inspect values at any point) and for models with dynamic structures (like some RNNs). TensorFlow 2.x, with Keras and Eager Execution, has largely adopted a dynamic graph philosophy, making it much more similar to PyTorch in this regard.

* **Debugging:**
    * **PyTorch:** Generally considered easier to debug due to its dynamic graphs, allowing standard Python debugging tools to be used directly.
    * **TensorFlow (TF 1.x):** Debugging static graphs could be more challenging, often requiring specialized tools like `tf.Session` and `tf.debugger`. TF 2.x's Eager Execution significantly improves debugging by behaving like standard Python.

* **Deployment & Production Readiness:**
    * **TensorFlow:** Historically, TensorFlow has had a stronger ecosystem for production deployment (e.g., TensorFlow Serving for production-grade model serving, TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge devices, TensorFlow.js for web).
    * **PyTorch:** While rapidly catching up (e.g., TorchServe), its production ecosystem has traditionally been less mature than TensorFlow's, though it's now widely used in production environments.

* **Learning Curve & Pythonic Nature:**
    * **PyTorch:** Often perceived as more "Pythonic" and intuitive for Python developers, making the learning curve slightly gentler for those already familiar with Python.
    * **TensorFlow (TF 2.x with Keras):** Has greatly simplified its API and made it more user-friendly, reducing the learning curve significantly compared to TF 1.x.

**When to Choose One over the Other:**

* **Choose TensorFlow when:**
    * **Production Deployment is a High Priority:** If your primary goal is to deploy the model to various environments (mobile, web, large-scale servers) with robust serving capabilities and specialized tools.
    * **Large-Scale Operations/Distributed Training:** Its mature tools for distributed training and its ecosystem are very powerful for massive datasets and models.
    * **Enterprise-Level Projects:** Many larger organizations have standardized on TensorFlow due to its stability, long-term support, and comprehensive ecosystem.

* **Choose PyTorch when:**
    * **Research and Rapid Prototyping:** Its dynamic nature and Pythonic interface make it excellent for experimentation, quickly iterating on ideas, and dealing with complex, custom model architectures.
    * **Academic Environments:** Widely adopted in academia due to its flexibility and ease of use for new research.
    * **Debugging Flexibility:** When you anticipate needing to frequently step through your model's execution and inspect intermediate values.
    * **Pythonic Simplicity:** If you prefer a framework that feels more like traditional Python programming.

In practice, with TensorFlow 2.x, the choice often comes down to personal preference, existing team expertise, and specific deployment needs, as both frameworks are incredibly powerful and converge on many best practices.

### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

Jupyter Notebooks are widely adopted in AI development due to their interactive nature and ability to combine code, output, and narrative in a single document. Here are two primary use cases:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Prototyping:**
    * **Description:** Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal environment for the initial stages of an AI project, particularly for understanding and preparing data. Data scientists can load datasets, inspect their structure (e.g., using `df.head()`, `df.info()`), visualize distributions (with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn), identify missing values, and quickly experiment with different data preprocessing techniques (e.g., scaling, encoding categorical variables). The cell-by-cell execution allows for immediate feedback on each step, making it easy to iterate and refine data preparation pipelines. For prototyping, developers can rapidly build and test small model architectures or algorithm snippets without the overhead of creating full scripts, seeing the results instantly.
    * **Why it's useful:** This interactive feedback loop significantly accelerates the understanding of data characteristics and the initial design of AI solutions. It helps in identifying potential issues early on and quickly validating hypotheses about data behavior or model performance.

2.  **Model Training, Evaluation, and Documenting Workflows:**
    * **Description:** Beyond initial exploration, Jupyter Notebooks are frequently used for the full lifecycle of model training and evaluation, especially for smaller to medium-sized experiments. Developers can write code to define model architectures (e.g., Keras models), set up training loops, and monitor performance metrics (like loss and accuracy) as training progresses. Crucially, the outputs (graphs of training history, confusion matrices, classification reports) are embedded directly within the notebook. Furthermore, Markdown cells can be interspersed with code to add detailed explanations, document design choices, explain evaluation results, or even jot down conclusions and next steps. This creates a living document that serves as both executable code and comprehensive project documentation.
    * **Why it's useful:** The ability to combine code, its output, and rich text explanations in one file makes notebooks excellent for reproducibility, sharing work with teammates (especially for peer review, as required in this assignment), and presenting findings to non-technical stakeholders. It streamlines the process of demonstrating how data flows through a model and what results are achieved.

    ### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

Basic Python string operations (like `str.split()`, `str.lower()`, `str.replace()`, and regular expressions using the `re` module) are fundamental for manipulating text data. However, they operate at a superficial, character or word-level and lack any true linguistic understanding. spaCy, on the other hand, is a powerful and efficient library specifically designed for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering a rich set of linguistic features that significantly enhance NLP tasks beyond what basic string operations can achieve.

Here's how spaCy provides significant enhancements:

1.  **Intelligent Tokenization:**
    * **Basic String Ops:** `text.split()` might split "don't" into "don" and "t", or separate punctuation incorrectly (e.g., "word." into "word" and ".").
    * **spaCy:** Uses a sophisticated, rule-based tokenizer that understands linguistic nuances. It correctly handles contractions ("don't" becomes "do", "n't"), identifies punctuation as separate tokens, and manages special cases like URLs, emails, and hashtags, providing more accurate and meaningful word units.

2.  **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**
    * **Basic String Ops:** No inherent capability to identify if a word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.
    * **spaCy:** Assigns grammatical categories (e.g., `NOUN`, `VERB`, `ADJ`) to each token. This is crucial for understanding sentence structure, disambiguating word meanings (e.g., "bank" as a noun vs. a verb), and for subsequent NLP tasks.

3.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    * **Basic String Ops:** Identifying entities like "Apple Inc." as an organization, "Tim Cook" as a person, or "London" as a location would require extensive, brittle, and manually curated regex patterns or lookup tables, which are highly prone to error and difficult to maintain.
    * **spaCy:** Comes with pre-trained statistical models capable of identifying and classifying named entities in text (e.g., `ORG`, `PERSON`, `GPE` for geopolitical entity, `DATE`, `MONEY`). This allows for automatic extraction of crucial information from unstructured text, which is nearly impossible with basic string operations alone.

4.  **Dependency Parsing:**
    * **Basic String Ops:** No understanding of the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
    * **spaCy:** Analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences, showing which words modify or relate to others (e.g., identifying the subject, object, and verbs). This is fundamental for advanced tasks like information extraction and semantic understanding.

5.  **Lemmatization:**
    * **Basic String Ops:** You might manually
